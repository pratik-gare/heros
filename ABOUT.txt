Ng Module?
- in app.module.ts
- Angular apps are modular called NgModule
- Atleast one module named AppModule
- Class with @NgModule Decorator (decorators, part of TS, are functions that modify JS classes)

Components?
- A class which interact with View
- Perform app logic
- There are many life cycle hooks

Templates?
- Tell Angular. how to render component
- Same as HTML but with some differences

Metadata?
- Tell Angular how to process class
- Attach metadata via Decorators
- @component decorator, identify class immediately below it

Directives?
